                    Bitcoin is a digital currency which operates free of any central control or the oversight of banks or governments. 
                    Instead it relies on peer-to-peer software and cryptography.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    A public ledger records all bitcoin transactions and copies are held on servers around the world. Anyone with a spare computer can set 
                    up one of these servers, known as a node. Consensus on who owns which coins is reached cryptographically across these nodes rather than 
                    relying on a central source of trust like a bank.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Every transaction is publicly broadcast to the network and shared from node to node. Every ten minutes or so these transactions are
                    collected together by miners into a group called a block and added permanently to the blockchain. This is the definitive account book of bitcoin.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    In much the same way you would keep traditional coins in a physical wallet, virtual currencies are held in digital wallets and can be accessed 
                    from client software or a range of online and hardware tools.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Bitcoins can currently be subdivided by seven decimal places: a thousandth of a bitcoin is known as a milli and a hundred millionth of 
                    a bitcoin is known as a satoshi.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    In truth there is no such thing as a bitcoin or a wallet, just agreement among the network about ownership of a coin. 
                    A private key is used to prove ownership of funds to the network when making a transaction. A person could simply memorise their private 
                    key and need nothing else to retrieve or spend their virtual cash, a concept which is known as a “brain wallet”.                </p>
